Spring 2014
<br><br>
Course Description:
<br>
During the spring semester, the focus of your study will be novels and poetry.  The novels will focus on the question: Are our lives more influenced by fate or free will?  Readings may include: The Cather in the Rye, Ethan Frome, Speak, an independent reading book, and the films Pleasantville and Into the Wild. 
<br>
<u>Expectations:</u>
1. Follow attendance, punctuality, and plagiarism guidelines as outlined in the HHS Student Handbook.                
<br>
2. Come to class prepared with pen/pencil, 3-ring binder, and course reading material and have them out on your desk at the start of class.
<br>
3. Keep a reader response journal.  Write a literary analysis essay, both in and out of class, a poetry explication paper, and a personal essay.  
<br>
4. Participate in a careful study of vocabulary and grammar.  
<br>
5. Submit work on time.  Late final drafts will be marked down for each day they are late.  Students may request an extension at least twenty-four hours in advance on major assignments.  Computer malfunctions do not qualify as legitimate excuses. Plan ahead, save all your work on a flash drive, share it with your teacher on a googledoc, and back it up on a hard drive. 
<br>
6. Use the x-day to attend draft conferences, get extra help, and make up missing work. All students must check in at the beginning of each x-day.  At times these will be required, full class sessions, but notification will usually occur in advance. Only students who have no missing work and who are passing the course may leave after checking in for an x-day. All others must stay to make up work or get extra help. Note: Late homework is a “0.”  You will stay in class the entire x-day after missing a homework assignment to work on upcoming assignments.  If you have been absent or have a grade below C, you should plan to stay for the x.  
<br>
7. Be considerate about eating in class. Students are allowed to eat in class but are not           allowed to miss class or be late to class in order to get food. Do not come to class and then ask to go to get food. If you are having trouble getting food during the school day, please see me.  
<br>
8. Follow the HHS academic honesty policy outlined in the handbook. I expect that all work you submit (homework, tests, papers, etc.) is your own.  If you use the ideas or words of another person, I expect you to cite those properly.
<br>
9. Turn in all major assignments in order to pass the course and maintain a writing portfolio.
<br>
10. Participate in class discussion. Class discussion is an essential component of this course, and the degree and quality of your participation in discussion will be reflected in your grade.  Appropriate participation means expressing your ideas and permitting others to do the same. It also means coming to class prepared to have a thoughtful discussion of the material we are studying.
<br>
11. Take the final exam.  All students, including those with an ‘A’ in class, must take the final.  
<br>
12. Put away phones, music players, headphones, iPads, computers etc. before class begins and without being asked. Any student using a phone or other device during class will have to turn the device into the teacher at the beginning of each class period for the remainder of the course.  
<br>
13. Be considerate and respectful of each other, the teacher, the educational assistants, and the physical classroom space we share.  This classroom should be a safe environment.
